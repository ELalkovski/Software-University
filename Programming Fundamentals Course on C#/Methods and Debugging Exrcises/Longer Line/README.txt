This program reads coordinates of four points in the 2D plane. 
The first and the second pair of points form two different lines. 
Prints the longer line in format "(X1, Y1)(X2, Y2)" starting with the point that is closer to the center of the coordinate system (0, 0).
If the lines are of equal length, prints only the first one.
