A master number is an integer that holds the following properties:
•	Is symmetric (palindrome), e.g. 5, 77, 282, 14341, 9553559.
•	Its sum of digits is divisible by 7, e.g. 77, 313, 464, 5225, 37173.
•	Holds at least one even digit, e.g. 232, 707, 6886, 87578.

This program reads an integer number and prints all master numbers in the range [1…n].
