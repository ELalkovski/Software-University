This program calculates the area of four different geometry figures - triangle, square, rectangle and circle.
On the first line you will get the figure type. Next you will get parameters for the chosen figure, each on a different line:
•	Triangle - side and height
•	Square - side
•	Rectangle - width and height
•	Circle - radius
The output should be rounded to the second digit after the decimal point
