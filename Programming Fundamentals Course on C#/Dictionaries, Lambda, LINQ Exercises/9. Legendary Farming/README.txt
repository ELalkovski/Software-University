The possible items are:
•	Shadowmourne – requires 250 Shards;
•	Valanyr – requires 250 Fragments;
•	Dragonwrath – requires 250 Motes;

Shards, Fragments and Motes are the key materials, all else is junk. 
The program reads lines of input, such as 2 motes 3 ores 15 stones. It keeps track of the key materials - the first that reaches the 250 mark wins the race. 
At that point, the program prints the corresponding legendary obtained. Then, prints the remaining shards, fragments, motes, ordered by quantity in descending order,
then by name in ascending order, each on a new line. Finally, it prints the collected junk items, in alphabetical order.
