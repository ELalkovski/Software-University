This program receives some info from the console about people and their phone numbers and puts into dictionaries.
Commands: 
•	A {name} {phone} – adds entry to the phonebook. In case of trying to add a name that is already in the phonebook you should change the existing phone number with the new one provided.
•	S {name} – searches for a contact by given name and prints it in format "{name} -> {number}". In case the contact isn't found, print "Contact {name} does not exist.".
•	END – stop receiving more commands.
