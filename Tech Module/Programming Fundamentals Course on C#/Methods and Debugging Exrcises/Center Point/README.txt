This program reads coordinates of two points on a Cartesian coordinate system - X1, Y1, X2 and Y2. 
Then creates a method that prints the point that is closest to the center of the coordinate system (0, 0) in the format (X, Y). 
If the points are on a same distance from the center, print only the first one.
