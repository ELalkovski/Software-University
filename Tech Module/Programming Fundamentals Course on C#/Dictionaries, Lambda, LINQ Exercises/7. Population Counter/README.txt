This program reads input lines in format: 
"city|country|population". 

Aggregates the data by country and by city and prints it on the console. 
For each country, prints its total population and on separate lines the data for each of its cities. 
Countries are ordered by their total population in descending order and within each country, the cities are ordered by the same criterion. 
If two countries/cities have the same population, keeps them in the order in which they were entered.
