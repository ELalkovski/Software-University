You will receive the amount of pictures she had taken. Then the approximate time in seconds for every picture to be filtered. 
Then a filter factor – a percentage (integer number) of the total photos (rounded to the nearest bigger integer value e.g. 5.01 -> 6) that are good enough to be given to her clients (Photoshop may do miracles but Thea does not).
Approximate time for every picture to be uploaded will be given again in seconds. Your task is: based on this input to display total time needed for her to be ready with the pictures in given below format.
